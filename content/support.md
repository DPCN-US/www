## Membership Levels

DPCN systems will always be free to use. All that's required is an amateur radio license and a compatible radio.

However, the systems do incur operational costs. DPCN [patrons](https://www.patreon.com/dpcn) receive special benefits and may choose from the following membership tiers:

Tier | Cost | Benefit
---- |---- | ------
Supporter | $1/month | Access to exclusive news and updates not yet released to the general public. 
Private Contact | $5/month | Add your callsign and name to the contact list of all radios on the system. 
Local Talkgroup | $10/month | Add a dedicated talkgroup to one repeater on the system. Recommended for smaller organizations with membership within range of a single repeater. 
Wide Talkgroup | $20/month | Add a dedicated talkgroup to all repeaters on the system. Recommended  for regional organizations with distributed membership. 
Zone | $50/month | Add a dedicated zone with multiple talkgroups. Talkgroups can be local or wide. Recommended for large organizations with multiple sub-organizations. 
Codeplug | $100/month | Get a dedicated codeplug, with all zones, channels, and contacts specified by you. This represents a substantial investment of time by system engineers. 

Your patronage helps support system maintenance and expansion and is greatly appreciated.
