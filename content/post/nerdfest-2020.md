Phil will be presenting at [NerdFest](https://indico.rmham.org/event/1/)! The topic is "DMR Efficiency via Controllerless Trunking."

The location is at [Cherry Creek Schools](https://goo.gl/maps/AZ93VQZH7M38KYqR9) and it starts at 08:00 on Saturday, February 15.

Here is the abstract:

> DMR spectrum utilization is suboptimal using conventional network  topologies. Trunking is a natural fit for DMR given its TDMA nature.  This talk explains how controllerless DMR trunking works and how it can  scale vertically to address shortcomings of conventional DMR systems. We then explore a theoretical implementation of a trunked DMR system in  the amateur radio spectrum, how that might be managed and administered,  and what advantages and disadvantages is has in relation to current  systems.

We hope to see you there! Please stay for the other presentations, they promise to be interesting.
