I'm afraid there may be some misconceptions about ham radio operators.

<!--more-->

Let me start with a descriptive list about them.

Not *every* ham radio operator is:

* Stuck in their ways
* Adverse to change
* Unwilling to learn
* Rigid
* Inflexible
* Curmudgeonly
* Ultraconservative

Some of us are:

* Explorers
* Dreamers
* Learners
* Teachers
* Ambitious
* Adaptive
* Hopeful
* Optimistic
* Disruptive
* Innovative
* Progressive
* Rebellious

Granted, there are some who embody the former list. They are often the loudest, and -- as we know -- the loudest voices in the group are often mistaken for the group as a whole. But ham radio operators are diverse. They do not all share the same reason for becoming licensed, nor do they share the same interests. The only commonality is radio.

I urge you not to be turned off by those cantankerous complainers. There is a niche for everyone in ham radio. Perhaps DPCN is the niche for you.
