Regarding FCC Rules ยง 97.119 on amateur station identification: the FCC doesn't want unidentified transmissions. Nor do most hams, for that matter. Unfortunately many hams take the rules strictly literally and do not interpret their meaning.

First, let us understand that trunked systems are limited collections of predetermined frequencies organized into logical channels for the purpose of spectral efficiency.

Some hams object to the use of trunked systems because a station may transmit on different frequencies during the course of a conversation without operator knowledge as to which specific frequencies he used.

However, the rules state that a ham must identify on the transmitting *channel*, not *frequency*. In addition, trunked radio on ham will not be causing transmissions on unknown frequencies: they are preprogrammed, limited, and known.

To quote the FCC,
> The purpose of the station identification rule is "to clearly make the identity of the station transmitting known to those receiving the transmission."

FCC rules go on to list a few ways to do that. Unfortunately this list predates modern digital protocols. I contend that globally unique DMR radio IDs, coupled with regular voice identification as per part 97, satisfy the spirit of the rules in the context of a centrally managed digital trunked radio system on amateur bands.

What is a callsign but a unique identifier? It doesn't tell you who the person is unless you look it up in a central database. The FCC maintains that database of amateur callsigns. [Radioid.net](http://radioid.net) is also a central database that links radio IDs to callsigns. This is why proper radio programming is important on trunked systems, and why DPCN prefers centralized management of system radios. Many hams do not properly program their DMR ID, but it is critical for the proper functioning of a trunked system as well as for identifying stations and remaining true to amateur radio station identification regulations.

Since it is unlikely that a ham can reprogram his radio ID mid-conversation, DPCN contends that a correctly programmed, globally unique DMR radio ID *with a publicly accessible database* will allow those receiving the transmission to identify the transmitting station. The only discrepancy comes from rules that predate modern digital communications technologies and are too narrow in scope to be interpreted broadly, needlessly stifling amateur radio innovation and experimentation.

However, this is merely the personal opinion of the author and not legal advice.
