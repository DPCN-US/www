He volunteered with [ARES](http://www.arrl.org/ares) while he was in Greeley, CO, and when he moved to Los Angeles, CA, he joined the [Los Angeles County Disaster Communications Service (LACDCS)](https://lacdcs.org). Upon returning home to Colorado, he volunteered with the Denver Police emergency group, DAREC, which morphed into the [Joint Communications Task Force](https://jctf.us). He currently volunteers with [Boulder County ARES](https://bouldercountyares.org) and his day job is at [CableLabs](https://www.cablelabs.com) as a Software Engineer. He is qualified in ICS-100, 200, 700, 800, but does not consider himself an expert or authority on EMCOMM.

He holds a Master of Science in Software Engineering, a Master of Fine Arts in Cinema-Television Production, and a Bachelor of Arts in Musical Theater.

He has a beautiful wife, [Kelly](/about/team/kelly) (KE0TIJ), and a beautiful son, [Alexander](https://watt.ws/agw) (born on his birthday!). His mother is also a ham (KC0ZBH), and she is beautiful as well. Alexander has not yet taken his Technician exam. ðŸ‘¶

His other interests include:

* Musical theater. He plays piano and has acted as musical director and accompanist for many productions. He will also perform on stage if needed.
* Home automation. Almost everything in his house that can be automated is. This is a never ending saga of software maintenance, hardware upgrades, and coding complex configuration files to ensure the minimum effort is expended turning on a light.
