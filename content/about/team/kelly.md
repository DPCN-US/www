![Kelly and Annie (canine)](/images/headshots/kelly.jpg)

Kelly's callsign is KE0TIJ. She has been licensed since 2019. Kelly obtained her technician license because she wanted to communicate with her ham husband, [Phil](/about/team/phil). She's still learning the lingo of amateur radio (apparently she's a "YL"), and she is especially excited for DPCN and all it can offer new and old ham radio operators alike. She supports DPCN in events, marketing, and fundraising.

Originally from central Illinois, Kelly moved to Colorado fifteen years ago to pursue a Master of Music from CU Boulder. She still performs occassionally in the Denver metro area, and she also enjoys making art, reading, and spending time with friends and family. Kelly has a son, [Alexander](https://watt.ws/agw), and a dog, [Annie](/about/team/annie) (as seen in her photo above).
