## Dues structure

`Operating cost / number of members`

The more hams who join, the lower the annual dues. The purpose of the dues is strictly to cover operational costs and enhance the network where need is greatest. The board will be responsible for setting a savings fund goal for network maintenance and expansion.

## Donated radios

Hams who cannot afford their own DPCN radio can join a waitlist. Donated radios will be assigned to waitlisted hams on a first-come, first-served basis. Donated radios will return to circulation when the member returns the radio or ceases to be a member.

## National organization, local scope

Local groups are responsible for building their own systems. The national organization exists to provide purchasing power, tax benefits, system and paperwork templates, operational infrastructure, and to reduce administrative overhead. This leaves local groups free to focus on growing their systems and memberships in order to best serve their local communities.

Local groups will receive national support based on a balance of the size of their membership and local infrastructure needs.
