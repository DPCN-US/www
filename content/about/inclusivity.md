DPCN networks do not discriminate or exclude. Hams of all races, religions, ethnicities, orientations, and identities are welcome.

<!--more-->

## No politics, no cliques, no exclusion.

Any ham with a valid license and a compatible radio can join. Users are asked to follow the [code of conduct](/about/code-of-conduct) and those who abuse their system privileges or may be locked out.

## Introverts welcome

Some hams want to quiet carry, where only calls directed to them or emergency traffic gets through. If this sounds familiar, DPCN is the system for you! You do not have to monitor a particular talkgroup if you don't want to. Unlike traditional repeaters, DPCN doesn't force you to listen to all traffic on the repeater that covers your area. You can remain on call without all the background noise.

## Accessibility

Visually impaired hams can add speech synthesis to their radios and the system administrator will work to build a configuration that provides audio feedback for all menus, channels, and contacts. This is also useful for situations where your visual attention must be elsewhere, e.g., while operating mobile.

## No restrictions

Have as many radios on the system as you want, talk as much as you want, with whomever you want. You buy the radios and DPCN will program them and maintain them for you, typically over the air: codeplug updates be performed over RF and firmware upgrades over Wi-Fi.

Don't worry about offending other hams: when you want to talk to another specific ham, use private calling. Talk about whatever you want, from the mundane to the provocative. Local DPCN systems can organize talkgroups by subject matter as well as by clubs or other member organizations.

## Club friendly

Want to start a club with like minded hams? Establish your presence on DPCN instead of putting yet another lightly used, single purpose repeater on the air. Poor DPCN coverage in your area? Help us work to expand the network and benefit all hams on the system.
