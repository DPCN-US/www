## Does DPCN only support DMR radios?

TL;DR: Yes, if the system is based on DMR. Plus it has to be whatever brand the individual DPCN system uses.

### Explain

DPCN systems use digital trunking, and currently only commercial standards such as [DMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_mobile_radio), [NXDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NXDN), [TETRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Trunked_Radio), and [P25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_25) support trunking. There are no ham-specific digital radio protocols that utilize trunking at this time (D-STAR, C4FM/Fusion). The protocol depends on the individual [system](/system). DPCN does not require a specific protocol, only certain functionality.

C4FM/Fusion and D-STAR are not compatible with the objectives of DPCN. However, that does not preclude local systems from linking talkgroups to multiprotocol reflectors that support other digital modes.

Additionally, the radios used on DPCN have to be commercial radios compatible with the system. See the specific [system](/system) for which radios are compatible.
