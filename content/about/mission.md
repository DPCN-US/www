DPCN's mission is to provide advanced infrastructure support to ham radio organizations and individuals.

<!--more-->

We accomplish this through:

* Experimentation: Our networks are testbeds for the latest digital radio technologies.

* Education: Interested hams are encouraged to volunteer and gain real world experience in digital radio systems design, management, and maintenance.

## Why DPCN

DPCN compliments current DMR networks by addressing some technical limitations:

* DPCN focuses on **simplicity**. By using commercial gear, hams can focus on the everyday use of their radios instead of having to interact with a complicated and confusing user interface.

* DPCN uses **trunking**, the dynamic allocation of repeater timeslots. This allows more hams to talk at once than with conventional systems.

* DPCN encourages **private calling**. Most everyday ham radio communications are one-on-one personal conversations, which needn't consume a timeslot on every linked repeater. DPCN systems only use the repeaters that the private calling radios are talking on, not the entire system.

* DPCN can **offload** routine traffic from mission critical systems, keeping them free for emergency and priority traffic during incidents and events.

* DPCN keeps the network **local**. DPCN systems typically do not link with global DMR networks.[^1] DPCN's purpose is to serve local ham communities first and to provide modern infrastructure where it's most needed: shared regional linked repeater systems that can accommodate many different clubs, associations, and users without interfering with each other.

* DPCN provides **logical infrastructure** in addition to physical infrastructure, decoupling the two. Until now, the two have been the same. Instead of setting up a new single-use repeater for a club, get a dedicated talkgroup on DPCN.

* DPCN uses **centralized management** for radio codeplugs. This relieves operators from having to spend hours programming their DMR radios. Modern digital commercial radio systems are designed for centralized management; updates are pushed out over the air.
