DPCN's mission is to provide advanced and modern infrastructure support to ham radio organizations and individuals.

<!--more-->

We accomplish this through:

* Experimentation: Our networks are testbeds for the latest digital radio technologies.
* Education: Hams with an interest in learning how the system works are encouraged to contact their [local system](/system). Some may even choose to join [our team](/about/team).

## Why DPCN

DPCN is a response to the current state of ham DMR networks and redresses some major technical shortcomings:

* DPCN uses **trunking**, which is the dynamic allocation of repeater timeslots. This allows more hams to talk at the same time than with conventional systems.
* DPCN encourages **private calling**. The bulk of everyday ham radio communications is one-on-one conversations of a personal nature. This is perfectly acceptable (some would say requisite), but it needn't consume a timeslot on every linked repeater. DPCN systems only use the repeaters that the private-calling radios are talking on, leaving other resources free for other calls.

* DPCN keeps the network **local**. DPCN systems typically do not link with global DMR networks.[^1] Other organizations exist for that.[^2] DPCN's purpose is to serve local ham communities first and to provide infrastructure where it's needed the most: regional linked repeater systems that can accomodate many different clubs, associations, and users without interfering with each other.

* DPCN provides ***logical* infrastructure** in addition to *physical* infrastructure, and decouples the two. Up until now, the two have been the same. E.g., Ham Club XYZ gets a repeater. It's the club's repeater and they use it. Instead, why not have DPCN provide a *talkgroup* to the club without having to use up more frequencies for another new club-specific repeater?
* DPCN uses **centralized management** for radio codeplugs. This relieves hams from having to waste time programming their DMR radios. If you are a ham who likes doing that, then please volunteer with your [local group](/system) to help manage their system. It is a time-consuming, complicated, and tedious process that has many avenues for error. However, if you'd rather reclaim your personal time for actually using your radio, outsource its management to DPCN system adminstrators. They will manage the programming remotely. Modern digital commercial radio systems are designed for centralized management and it is trivial to add another radio. You won't have to waste time to physically meet up with the person who has the latest codeplugs, or scour the Internet for a compatible codeplug file. You can get an update pushed out over the air when there are changes.
