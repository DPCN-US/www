This code of conduct applies to all users of any DPCN system. Most of it is either common sense or simply being a good person, but there are a few unique gotchas.

By using DPCN, you agree to abide by the following guidelines:

* No profanity.
* No hate speech.
* No personal attacks.
* Do not share codeplug with non-DPCN users.

Failure to adhere to this guide may result in banishment from the system and/or termination of membership.
