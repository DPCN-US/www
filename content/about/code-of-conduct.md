This code of conduct applies to all users of any DPCN system. Most of it is either common sense or simply being a good person, but there are a few unique gotchas.

By using DPCN, you agree to abide by the following guidelines:

* No profanity.
* No hate speech.
* No personal attacks.
* No intentional interference.
* No commercial activity.
* No racism, sexism, or discrimination based on any [federally protected classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_group).
* No illegal activity.
* Abide by all relevant FCC regulations.
* Do not utilize the emergency channel unless it is a true emergency.
* Do not share your radio codeplug with non-DPCN users.

Remember, private calls and text messages are not only allowed but encouraged.

Failure to adhere to this guide may result in removal from the system and/or termination of membership.
